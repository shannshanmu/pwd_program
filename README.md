# pwd_program

4 password programs, merged into one simple .exe file:
1. A normal password strength checker
2. A random password generator
3. A rememberable password generator
4. A dicer for strings (slices them randomly)
5. And a diceware-like password generator - for more info, go to https://diceware.dmuth.org/

## to-do list
* implement simple exit process by typing e another key relating to exit. (could also implement try, except catch for EOFError that arises when Ctrl-D is pressed.)
* acquire a better method of generating random numbers for the generator (as randint() is not random!).
* keep .txt files with the passwords that already have been generated on it. (problem of how to check for passwords generated on other computers arises.)
* complete this to-do list...
